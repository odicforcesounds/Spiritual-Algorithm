# Debug JavaScript

[<<<](./03.06_README.md)

- What kind of errors we can find: 
	- Logic Errors ( dificult to find )
	- Syntax Errors ( Our IDE help us to find )
	- Always READ to error message. ( always help in most cases )
	- If the error message is not intuitive to read, paste error message in Google
	- Using VSCode or Vim8, with NodeJS plugins, all lines that are incorrect, will be highlight (ESLint FEATURES)
	- For each step / cycle, if Google cannot help, use console.log('Message') to understand what is wrong.
	- Use Chromium / Firefox DevTools to debug our code. (chromium is recommended)
