# Declaring and Defining Variables

<button>[<<<](./02.02_README.md)</button>

- The **=** is used to assign data to a variable. When we call that variable, will print the contained data 

- Variable Naming: Defining a name which is intuitive to know what the variable store
  - Allowed Techniques
  1. camelCase: First word start with no Uppercase and all other words do. Eg. myFirstName
  2. group1: Variables can have at the end a number
  3. $monkey: Variables can start with a dolar symbol 
  4. _ok_: Variables can start and end with a underscore
  
  - Not Allowed / Not Recommended
  1. Snake_Ä‰ase: ( not good pratice )
  2. 1group: variables cannot start with numbers
  3. some-name: **-** is a operator, therefor we cannot use **-** to name variables 

- Try to be consistent
  - Almost use cases, don't need **;** per line. While using **;** is optional, it is recommended

- Examples:

  - Create a variable
```js
let currentResult
```
  - Initialize a Variable
```js
let currentResult = 0; 
```
