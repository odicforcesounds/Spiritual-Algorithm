# Importing scripts using defer and async

<button>[<<<](./02.25_README.md)</button>

- If JavaScript scripts are loaded at the beginning of HTML page, they execute before rendering the page. 

- Use the developer tools and switch to performance tab, to see what we can do better. 

- Normally, javascript scripts, are linked at the end, before the closing HTML **body**  tag

- To get better performance, we can import the JavaScript scripts in the **head** tag section with defer option

```html
<script src="app.js" defer></script>
```

- If using async, scripts are executed as faster they can, while does not wait to HTML page to be parsed.
