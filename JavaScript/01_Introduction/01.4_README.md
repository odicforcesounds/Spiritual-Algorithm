<button>[<<<](./01.3_README.md)</button>

- Dynamic, Interpreted Programming Language
  1. Not pre-compiled, instead parsed and compiled, "on the fly"
  2. Code evaluated and executed at runtime
  3. can change at runtime

- Weakly Typed Programming Language
  1. Data types are assumed.
  2. In all Programming Languages variables cannot change their types
  3. if We try to change the type of a variable will print an **Error**
