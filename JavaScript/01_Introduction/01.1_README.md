<button>[<<<](../README.md)</button>

- "JavaScript is a Dynamic Weakly Typed Programming Language which is compiled at runtime. Can be executed in a Web Browser or in any Machine without Network"

- "JavaScript was created to make Web Pages more Dynamic.(Aims to change content on a page directly from inside a browser).  Originally was called LiveScript but due the popularity of Java, was renamed to JavaScript"

Pre-Concepts: 
  - Any computer online is a **Host**
  - Any computer online can share a **Service**
  - When a online computer **Offer** a Service, is called SERVER
  - When a online computer **Request** a Service, is called CLIENT
  - For each CLIENT Request, the SERVER **Respond** with __new__ Web Page content (HTML and CSS + Data)
  - To change the content of the first page without asking a new page to change the content of the page, we can use JavaScript
