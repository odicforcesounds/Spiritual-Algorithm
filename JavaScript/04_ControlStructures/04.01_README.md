## Conditional code and loops. 

- Glad we can loop X times the same answer to the same question. 
- How many times users / service needs or define. 
- Glad develpers don't need to write X times the same answer to the same question. 
- Developers define a rotine one single time, which execute X times. 

- Conditions in programming is one of the base core knowledge of any language. 
- If we think, what realy in life don't need conditions? 
- From the language it self ( in this example english), we can say: 
  1. "if we study JavaScript we write good code faster"
  2. "if we don't study Javascript we will spend more time trying to build what we wish"
  3. "if we drive faster, we can arrive to the destiny or not, because faster don't means secure"
  4. "if the world focus on positive thoughts, the world will build a positive society"
