## Conditional Code Execution

- In the process of learning [JavaScript Basics](../02_Basics/02.01_README.md) we build a simple calculator. 
- We didn't use conditional core features. 
- The only condition needed is user existence and click events associated to HTML buttons.
- Lets try to build a simple game.
  1. Conditions depends on Booleans values (true or false)
- What is true? What is false? 
  1. What developers define as true or false, and what is the value and the type of the value. 
  "We are developing people by what we express with our personal perspective or **true** or **false** "
- Since we didn't use conditions, the code of the calculator become a little bigger. 
- In this module we will learn how to simplify that code. 

### Boolean Operators

- Remember the **=** sign? We use it to assign data into a variable
- Using **==** sign, we check for value equality
- Using **!=** sign, we check for value inaquality
- Using **===** sign, we check for value and type equality

```js
2 == 2 // print true
2 == "2" // print true
2 === "2" // print false ( naturally a number is a different value of the string with a number )
```
- We always should use the **===** to code better because our intentions are clear and explicit
- We can  use **>** and **<** to know if value is bigger than or smaller then... 
- WE can use **>=** and **<=** to know if value is bigger or equal to...
- We can use **!** to negate ( to declare false value )
- If a value is already false and we negate, it becomes true.
