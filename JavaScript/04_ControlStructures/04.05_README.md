# The Logical AND and OR Operators

### Combining Conditions

- Because conditions can be nested inside other conditoons, lets Imagine the next situation.

Condition_A: name === 'Oscar';
Condition_B: age === 40; 
Condition_C: isAdmin === true;

Condition_A AND Condition_B OR Condition_C 

- to express an AND we use **&&** 
- to express an OR we use **||**

- Using **&&** (AND) all condition need to be true 
- Using **||** (OR), one of the sub-conditions needs to be true
